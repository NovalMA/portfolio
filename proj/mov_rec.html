    <h3>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
    <p>This movie totally caught me off-guard. Following its first film, I came into the cinema looking forward to a feel-good movie but found myself crying in just its first scene. </p>
    <h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
    <p>The trilogy, of which this film belongs to, is the best portrayal of batman so far - I appreciate how much realistic aspects has been applied to the the plot of these movies and the visual effects of the last 2 films. However, I hold The Dark Knight on a higher pedestal since it has some mind-blowing twists and Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of The Joker.</p>
    <h3>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</h3>
    <p>I love the developments of the plot, along with the movies themes and humor. </p>
